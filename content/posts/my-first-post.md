## Introduction

Hello! My name is **Jordyn Crosby** and i'm making this website partially because I want a career in web design but also because I want to get my life more together in an online setting. I'm starting off my website in a few different directions. 

    1. Social Media
    2. Programming 
    3. A blog

And more to come in the future!

Anyways I hope you enjoy my website and feel free to navigate around it and if you're especially interested, i'm open to any ideas on what I should do with this website!

Best Wishes, Jordyn
